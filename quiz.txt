Answer: Code 2

Reason: 
Code1 will also work but that's a bad practise that can cause expensive issues in other scenarios, 
Code1 will work in this situation because we are logging the event target innerHTML. Even though the event bubbles up to the wrapper event handler, 
as long as the user clicks the child(animal) element, the event will have the child element as target.

But if we are logging currentTarget innerHTML, code1 will give us a different result from expectation, 
because currentTarget represents the element where the actual event handler is running.


P.S:- Both code is missing the `key` attribute
